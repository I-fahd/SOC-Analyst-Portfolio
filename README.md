# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Portfolio – Fahad Algethami

Welcome to my SOC Analyst portfolio.  
This repository documents my hands-on learning and alert analysis practice through simulated SOC investigations on the LetsDefend platform.

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate my SOC L1 alert triage process, investigation methodology, and documentation skills.

---

## 🎯 Repository Objective

This repository is designed to showcase:

- How I analyze and validate SOC alerts  
- My investigation thought process step-by-step  
- How I determine whether an alert is a True Positive or False Positive  
- How I document incidents clearly and professionally  

All cases are analyzed from a SOC L1 perspective.
